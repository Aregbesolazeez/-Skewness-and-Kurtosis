# 📊 Skewness and Kurtosis

This post is part of my **Beyond the Numbers** series, where I break down core statistical concepts using simple code and real-world examples.

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- ✅ **Skewness**: Is your data leaning to the left or right?
- ✅ **Kurtosis**: Are there heavy tails or extreme outliers?

We often focus on averages and spread, but understanding the **shape** of a dataset can help detect hidden patterns, anomalies, or risk factors.

## 📦 What’s Inside

- Simulated customer spending data using `rnorm()`
- R code using the `e1071` package for skewness and kurtosis
- Histogram & density plots
- Real-world interpretation using a courier delivery scenario

## 🔍 Why It Matters

Whether you're in finance, logistics, or education, **skewed or heavy-tailed data** can impact decisions—from pricing to resource planning.
